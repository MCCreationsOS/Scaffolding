"Revengeance II",1,"1.20.1","https://www.minecraftmaps.com/adventure-maps/revengeance-ii/download-map",,"<p class=""font_8"">America, 1900. The western states are experiencing an economic boom fueled by an interest in mining for natural resources, powered by a new railroad. But something else has crippled the region: the rise of Undead monsters who attack the citizens every night. As a member of The Law, it’s up to you to put an end to this misery, and rule the ascendancy of the Undead once and for all.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">The hit map <a href=""https://www.minecraftmaps.com/adventure-maps/revengeance""><strong>Revengeance</strong></a> was released in 2021 and has amassed over 40,000 combined downloads. Now, <strong>Revengeance II</strong> is the long-awaited sequel, expanding and building upon everything that made the first map great. Revengeance II is an action-packed horror adventure map complete with ten story Quests, side missions, an in-game currency system, boss battles, a huge open world, fast travel system, and much more.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><br></p>
<p class=""font_8"">This map is Chris6d’s eighth map overall, and his finest work yet. It’s the map you didn’t know you needed until now. You don’t need to play the first Revengeance before playing this one (unless you want some story context), but feel free to play it afterwards if you want. All of the rules and settings, as well as the Resource Pack, will be provided when you load the map.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">All levels have been tested numerous times by multiple people, and are possible to complete. So please download the map and play it for yourself, and feel free to make YouTube videos and walkthroughs of this map!</p>","https://youtu.be/00arp0LYTbM",,2023-10-03T17:39:03Z,,,"[{""description"":"""",""slug"":""88050d_4d008eab2f844334af03f1ab3323aac8~mv2.png"",""alt"":"""",""src"":""wix:image://v1/88050d_4d008eab2f844334af03f1ab3323aac8~mv2.png/Revengeance%2520II.png#originWidth=1920&originHeight=1080"",""title"":""Revengeance II.png"",""type"":""image"",""settings"":{""width"":1920,""height"":1080,""focalPoint"":[0.5,0.5]}},{""description"":"""",""slug"":""88050d_ad0aad235b594d08868e07942c96efe7~mv2.png"",""alt"":"""",""src"":""wix:image://v1/88050d_ad0aad235b594d08868e07942c96efe7~mv2.png/Revengeance%2520II%2520(1)..png#originWidth=1920&originHeight=1080"",""title"":""Revengeance II (1)..png"",""type"":""image"",""settings"":{""width"":1920,""height"":1080,""focalPoint"":[0.5,0.5]}},{""description"":"""",""slug"":""88050d_dc865c5456b44730944b43b24ad5562e~mv2.png"",""alt"":"""",""src"":""wix:image://v1/88050d_dc865c5456b44730944b43b24ad5562e~mv2.png/Revengeance%2520II%2520(2)..png#originWidth=1920&originHeight=1080"",""title"":""Revengeance II (2)..png"",""type"":""image"",""settings"":{""width"":1920,""height"":1080,""focalPoint"":[0.5,0.5]}}]","wix:image://v1/88050d_786d3a2249264707b9fbfdcb3859b014~mv2.png/Revengeance%20II%20Title%20Pic.png#originWidth=1920&originHeight=1080","America, 1900.
