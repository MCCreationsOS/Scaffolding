Use the Wooden Sword to break the cobwebs. Use the Pebble to break the white stained glass. Retrieve the feather out of the white stained glass. Grab the dead bush out of the flower pot.<br/><br/>Step 2. Find 3 crafting recipes. Craft the dead bush into sticks. Then take 3 sticks and 3 string and craft a bow. Finally craft one arrow. Shoot the unlit torch so it lights up, which opens the next room.<br/><br/>Step 3. Grab the Stone Head out of the furnace in the ceiling. Run back to the first room and throw it on top of the cobblestone block. Go down the ladder after the block breaks.<br/><br/>Step 4: The red concrete controls the red particles. The yellow concrete controls the yellow particles. The green concrete controls the green particles. The blue concrete controls the blue particles. The water head releases some water. Make the water stream turn the concrete powder into concrete in this order: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue.<br/><br/>Step 5: Go back to room 2 (check experience bar for room #). Place the maps onto the item frames in the order:<br/>L A T C H. That will give you a tripwire_hook labeled latch. Go back to the first room.<br/><br/>Step 6: Throw the Latch onto the door like structure (two trapdoors one on top the other. Go through into the next room.<br/><br/>Step 7. Place the book down onto the Lectern. Read the second riddle provided. It basically says, that a seven needs to be shown in the room you are standing in to have something open. The only thing that has numbers is the book, which are the page numbers in the book. Change the book to page 7.<br/><br/>Step 8: Go back to room 2, and walk up to the now opened vent. Crawl through and get to the other side. Press the buttons to shift the floor blocks. Have them line up with the other side. If you can&#x27;t do it follow the video guide or go into creative mode. Once done, the music will play and an eye of ender will be given to you.<br/><br/>Step 9: Go to room 2, and place the eye of ender in the end portal frame. The eyes will move and open up a new room.<br/><br/>Step 10: Go into the next room. Notice how the maps cannot line up. Remove all the maps, except for the one you cannot remove. The map you can&#x27;t remove is your starting map. Place the maps until the picture lines up. Once done 7 iron will spawn. Find the other recipe that is located in the room. Craft the cauldron in the first room. Place the cauldron in the first room, under where the dripping is.<br/><br/>Step 11: A rabbit has spawn in the map. Simple. Find Mr. Bun Bun and kill him. What? You have no soul anyways. Throw Mr. Bun Bun&#x27;s Foot into the Cauldron. Jump into the cauldron to gain jump boost and go to room 3 (the room with the water puzzle) and jump up into the hole in the ceiling. Jump down into the next room.<br/><br/>Step 12: Trade your stone button for a Golden Hoe. Go back up by going into the corners with the particles. Go to Room 2 and place the golden hoe into the furnace. Grab the golden nugget and go back to the villager. Trade the villager for the chest.<br/><br/>Step 13: Place down the chest right where the villager was. Grab all the contents from the chest. Find the recipe in the room. Go back up by going into the corners with the particles. Bring the unfired clay to the furnance, and get the bricks out of the furnace. Craft the two pots. Go back to the Flower Map Room. Place all of the flowers down in their correct location. In the room with the villager you have to place down the pots before you place the plants.<br/><br/>Step 14: Once done with the return to the Flower Map room. A map should have spawned if you did it right. Get the map and place it into the empty item frame in room 2. Grab the Match and light the campfire. Go into the next room and read the sign.<br/><br/>Step 15: The sign states to go to room 2 and find something that holds time. If you check all of room 2, you find nothing. However by switch the M item frame upside down, the word Match becomes the word Watch (insert Spongebob Mini Wumbo reference). Bring this watch to the new room and drop it.<br/><br/>Step 16: The room is a parkour room! Fun!. Basically follow the video to see how it is done, but this is mainly a skill section, therefore hints cannot be helpful. Once you finish the parkour place the clock in the item frame. You fall down and find out that it is a clock with a bell. Simple. <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Ring the Bell once.</span> This will show the location of a invisible Pillager.<br/><br/>Step 17: Find the Pillager in the water puzzle room. You can randomly punch to find it. The book you get is a mock Copy of the other guide book. Place it on the opposing side of the mirror rooms. If you read the other puzzle, it says that once both pages are placed you have to find the pages in each book that are identical. So make sure both pages are set to Page 3. This will open the trapdoor leading to the final room.<br/><br/>Step 18: Crawl through the vents and when you get to the other room, hit the button on the ceiling. You will be given a poppy and the room is a code. Each part of the code can be found on player heads in their respective room. For the black code, you will have to either change your perspectives (F5) or get jump boost to see it. For the purple code, you will have to travel through ghosts blocks to find it. Don&#x27;t worry you just have to find the part of the wall that is indented.<br/><br/>Step 19: Once you collected all of the numbers for the code. It will be the number &quot;3928417&quot;. Rename the poppy to this number and place it into the dropper. The door will break revealing Cuddle&#x27;s Grave. Take Cuddle&#x27;s head out of the chest and place it in the spot you took the feather in the first rooms. Cuddles will speak and the place you feel down from will open back up. It will give you levitation and you will be at the area before the boss battle.<br/><br/>Step 20: Memorize the two recipes (but they are also provided in the boss battle). Click the button to go into the boss battle. Look at Cuddles Eyes. If the right eye becomes red, head to the left side of the stage, if the left eye becomes red head to the right side of the stage. When both eyes are red, the middle two platforms will be bombed!. Make sure you grab the items that Cuddles drop. After the stage when both eyes become red, the Custom Crafting Table will spawn on the side. Be careful! The Custom Crafting Table only lasts for long enough to craft one item, so you will have to wait for another cycle. When you craft a bow and arrow, fire at Cuddles Eyes when they turn into End portal gates. You know when you have successfully hit his eyes when they turn into Magma blocks. When both of his eyes are magma blocks he loses a health point, and the next level of the cycle is available.<br/><br/>Step 21: After you damage Cuddles the cycle resets again. So you have to make it through the eggs part again. After the eggs part. The next cycle will activate. During this stage, Cuddles eyes will change into three colors, and those colors are the colors of the platforms you are on. Those three colored platforms will be destroyed, so you have to get to the color he did not choose. Then a second round of that happens, but it is faster than before. Once you get past that segment shoot both of his eye, just like before, and damage him.<br/><br/>Step 22: The cycle resets again, so you have to make it through the eggs and platform breaking section again. After that the final section will start. In this section, an Invisible Vindicator spawns riding on a bee. There will also be a bell that spawns and despawns. You have to hit the bell, with a arrow, early and let it ring out. It will show where the Vindicator is by making it glow. Simply shoot the Vindicator and kill it. Once you have done that you will get 3 prismarine shards and a map of a recipe for a trident. The cycle will reset after a bit of the Vindicator part.

It is about my experience with the IB Diploma Program, and is a story told in map form. It is a direct message to all who may potentially take it in the future, and merely a good story for those who do not. Because I am a maker of mazes, it is a maze map. In this, I will take you through the past 2 years of my life, with a maze representative of each season from Spring of 2019 to Winter of 2021.<br>\n<br>\nI mentioned earlier that this map touches upon some serious topics. If you are sensitive to that kind of content, I would advise you not play this map. IB is a program that causes great distress in its students, and I address this in my map.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point, I'm sure you are wondering what exactly IB is. Well, in the map, I explain this, and I also link to their website, but on the off-chance that those measures aren't enough, I shall inform you here as well:</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">The IB Diploma Program is an optional program of studies for one's final two years of high school, offered around the globe. Upon completion, one will be awarded an extra diploma: the IB Diploma. Once you have made the decision to take IB, it will last from the Summer before junior year until Spring of your senior year. It is incredibly challenging and has many aspects that differentiate it from other Honors programs, such as AP or DE.<br>\n<br>\nThis map is about my experience with IB, from the time before I joined to right now. My goal is not to convince you to take IB, but to avoid it. IB is not worth taking, and it will leave you worse than before.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis map has a playtime of around 30 minutes in total, and supports as many players as you can imagine.<br>\n<br>\nThe only real rules to this map are to ensure your render distance is set to 20, that your particles are on minimal, not to cheat, and to have fun.</p>","files":[{"type":"","worldUrl":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/1wypdpu9sv0e5dg/On_Mazes_and_the_IB_Diploma_Program.zip/file","resourceUrl":null,"minecraftVersion":"1.16.4","contentVersion":null}],"images":["https://mccreations.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/On-Mazes-and-the-IB-Diploma-Program_image_0.png","https://mccreations.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/On-Mazes-and-the-IB-Diploma-Program_image_1.png","https://mccreations.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/On-Mazes-and-the-IB-Diploma-Program_image_2.png","https://mccreations.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/On-Mazes-and-the-IB-Diploma-Program_image_3.png"],"shortDescription":"This map is inspired from the unfair map series we all enjoyed.This map is a short unfair map which is space themed.Many new textures and 3d models make the map more appealing to play.

The runner(s) have to mine blocks and collect resources to escape, while the hunter(s) are tracking them down. If the runner(s) escape the map and step on the pressure plates, they win. If the hunter(s) eliminate the/a runner, the hunter(s) wins. How do you escape? The first way is to mine through the map. This is easier said than done for the whole map is surrounded with obsidian and netherite blocks. Crafting a diamond pickaxe is&nbsp;pretty much vital. The other way to escape is through the lava gate entrance. The runner would have to press a button and wait for the lava to flow out of the way, however, this will probably be heavily guarded and blocked off. (There is an option that can block it off with netherite blocks meaning the runner(s) can only escape by breaking out of the map). There are many other options to play around with which can help balance the game.

The land of Kohzin, and the city of Foye, are facing a terrible crisis: Undead monsters rise from the ashes each night, and unleash terror upon the citizens. On top of this, the local Bandits own the town, and the local government is as corrupt as they come. The choice on whether to save this town and your family from utter terror, or to continue the enemies’ destiny and destroy everything in your path, is yours.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">After over six months of work, Chris6d is proud to present Revengeance, his third open-world adventure map, and fifth map overall. This map features over 5,000 command blocks and a plethora of features, including 10 story missions with a branching story and multiple endings, side activities, free-roam, combat, custom boss battles, puzzles, parkour, custom Achievements, in-game Currency and Upgrade system, and much more!</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Revengeance also features dialogue choices with branching dialogue, a Reputation system, and Good/Evil missions which you can choose. So, do you want to play as a hero and avenge your family, or as a villain and betray those you love? Again, the choice is yours, and those choices <em>will </em>affect the story.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">All the rules, regulations and settings can be found on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hn_ob3CFwyIrXwUUaWE7PAKEEhTGHjTvaTJk-5MMeUQ\" target=\"undefined\"><u>this PDF page</u></a>, which the map will ask you to read when you load it.

When you start the map, you should spawn in a room containing all the settings and rules of the map. If you don't spawn in that room, teleport to -338 77 -179.</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">If you like this map, be sure to upvote it and I will make more maps!

This is no ordinary villain, seeking destruction intentionally, or even talking at all. No, this villain is my awful map-making skills from 2 years ago. This is a more polished version of the first map I published, restructured with the intent of easing the pain of anyone who plays it. </p><p> </p><p>The basic premise of the map is that there is one giant maze, with portals to separate mazes within it. One must complete the first maze before being able to travel through the first door, beyond which is the second maze, which one must complete before traveling through the second door, and so on and so forth. There are 12 mazes in total, not including the hub maze (dubbed &quot;seizure subway&quot; by my friend because of its awful color scheme), and they increase in difficulty as the map goes on. For the sake of convenience, I have added buttons which teleport you to the gateways for each maze, which you can unlock as soon as you complete that level. These may not seem that handy early on, but rest assured they become helpful towards the later stages of the map.</p><p> </p><p>Speaking of helpful stuff, I suppose it&#x27;s about time to give you some tips on how to survive this map, from both a map-creator and a map-solver&#x27;s standpoint!</p><p>- In the hub maze, left tends to be a better choice than right.</p><p>- Take breaks! Trying to finish this all in one sitting is not a wise idea.</p><p>- You can&#x27;t die by fire, lava, drowning, or fall damage, so don&#x27;t worry about that!</p><p>- Use the cyan button at spawn after completing Vile Village, it takes you to right where you want to go.<br/>- Once you&#x27;ve unlocked the magenta button, that one will be your best bet for the next few mazes. <br/>- The red door is past the purple door. I spent forever searching for that thing.<br/>- In my opinion, the last maze is the best maze. If you just want to skip to that one, teleport to 330 5 800<br/>- Return to spawn at any time by teleporting to 966 5 728<br/><br/>In terms of rules, all you need to do is set render distance to 20+, set particles to minimal, and graphics to fast.

You can play by yourself or with others. If you play with others, there is a large variety of multiplayer options, such as Mario Kart-style items to mess with each other. Everyone also has the glowing effect so you can see where everyone is. When Minecraft updates to future versions (1.18.2, 1.19, etc), I will update this.</p><p> </p><p>I HIGHLY recommend that you visit the Extras hallway. There are 4 extra settings: Skip Levels, Enable Music, Enable Items, and Anti-Cheat. The Skip Levels setting is already on by default, where you can skip levels you don&#x27;t like by casting the fishing rod (but it&#x27;ll cost you a point). You can also listen to the Pigstep disc while you play, and you can prevent people from going into creative. If you enable items, you will receive 2 items every 4 stages you complete, where 1 will benefit you, 1 will hurt others. You can only choose one, and you use an item by dropping it.</p><p> </p><p>You can also end a game at any time. To end a game, all players need to agree on it by dropping the firework they&#x27;ll receive.

Every time you step on one your exact position is saved. These have been placed throughout the map where it was seen fit. You can unlock the next level by finding its portal. Once you pass the Nether Portal in the Overworld the Nether level is unlocked, etc. You can use the Carrot on a Stick in your inventory to get back to the lobby at any time by simply right clicking. Be warned however, that when re-entering the level by use of the button you will be spawned back at the beginning. In the Nether and Overworld levels, simply step on a Coarse Dirt or fall into the lava to return to your last checkpoint. There are no &quot;checkpoints&quot; in the End however so it is not recommended you use this feature there. The End level has no checkpoints per se(as mentioned above) however the level is designed to have built in checkpoints so don&#x27;t worry. You have 1 hour to complete the map and your time is displayed in the action bar. When the time runs out a title is simply displayed telling you that you have lost, however you may continue the play the map if you wish as nothing really changes. It was set up as more of an additional challenge than anything else. When you complete a level there is always a floating gem. Don&#x27;t expect to actual pick it up and don&#x27;t freak out when you get teleported to the lobby without it</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">MORE MAP INFO</span></h2><p>This map was originally intended to be more of an adventure parkour map than it is at the moment so somethings may seem a little odd or like there&#x27;s something missing. Don&#x27;t worry about this, everything is working as intended. Just treat the map like an average parkour map. I&#x27;ve spent over a year working on this map so some sections were added later. This may cause a slight disruption in the flow of the map and if it does I apologize.

Turn around. I&#x27;ve got, what? 23? 24 other maps? You don&#x27;t have to play this one! In fact, I encourage you not to- it&#x27;s simply not worth it! This map is a curiosity, something to look at, wonder about, pity the souls who&#x27;ve actually tried it, and move on. It&#x27;s not meant to be played, that would just be sadistic.<br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">It&#x27;s pretty darn difficult.</span><br/><br/>Okay, look: I know &quot;hardest&quot; is subjective, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this one fits just about everyone&#x27;s definition. It&#x27;s massive, to start: I accidentally made it bigger than the previous world record for the largest maze, so technically that title fits it as well? I didn&#x27;t intend to, I only figured that out at the end, with an extra 50 thousand cells on the prior record. Next, it&#x27;s a water maze- do you know how frustrating those are with their 3-dimensional thinking? And the dead ends, dear lord! They range from small and harmless to branches upon branches of dead ends, spanning large swathes of the map! If you took the main path e x a c t l y , not making a single wrong turn, it would still take you hours to beat this maze. The only kind of person who would enjoy this map is a literal masochist, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that even THEY would have doubts!<br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">There&#x27;s not even a point to it!</span><br/><br/>You would gain absolutely nothing from playing this map!

I don&#x27;t expect ANYONE to beat this map, not even one person!! I recommend Library of Babble or Daedalic Atonement: those are good maps, at least! This is anything but. <br/><br/><br/><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Move on.</span><br/><br/>So, if you decide to play it, I can&#x27;t stop you.

There are content warnings in the map itself, these are just a forewarning of sorts: this map is not a happy map. This map is a dark map, telling a dark tale. This map has mention of trauma, depression, mental disorders, and suicide, as well as mention of inappropriate activities.

Those ratings shouldn’t have any effect on overall performance, which is then judged. Any full-time under five minutes is considered passable, and anything under two minutes and twenty seconds is considered flawless. If ever at any point you become stuck or lost, drop the “Return To Checkpoint” item from your hotbar. If ever at any point you wish to restart your run drop the “Reset” item from your hotbar.

If you fall into it, you are thrown off the main board to get out of the Volcano, which is 10 spaces long.

The city started off as a small roleplay map with just a couple buildings and an inn. As more people joined to help out, the city quickly began to grow and by December that year, the small buildings and houses were replaced by towering skyscrapers. Within a year, it became one of the biggest cities on the Brawl Build server. In late 2020, the Bessemer City map and team left the Brawl Build server, and now is operating on a private server.</p><p>The city boasts a large downtown area, a developing metro, a vast network of bike and public transport lines, and even a sewer system. There are also two major highways running through the map, I-67 and I-467, the latter cutting directly through the downtown area. Most of the buildings are inspired from real-life buildings, such as the PNC Tower from Louisville and the US Bank Building from Denver in the United States.</p><p>The city project has led to the creation of another district of the city, Saluda, which began in January 2020. Saluda is a suburban commercial town north of Bessemer City’s position, and is also where the various sports stadiums, hotels, restaurants, stores, and the massive Hiwassee University are all located.</p><p>After a brief hiatus following the release of V2.0 in March 2021, work quickly resumed on the city, focusing its efforts on drastically improving realism throughout the map. New features such as rolling hills, dense forests, and twisting and turning roads have been added in the northern part of the map. Further south, the river has been upgraded and expanded, as well as the streets and roads of the city. Another major goal has been to improve the look and feel of the downtown at its street level, and this has been achieved through 23 new and improved buildings, countless new custom trees, bike and bus lanes, and even a huge new city park.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Version 2.1 Updated Features List:</span> This update focused mainly on improving the look, feel, and realism of the entire map, as well as updating and expanding the Downtown area.</p><ul><li>2.1.1 SPECIFIC: Updated resource pack for texture resolution consistency</li><li>Added 23 new buildings / skyscrapers to Downtown</li><li>Revamped and added several streets in Downtown</li><li>Added new custom trees and greenery all throughout the map</li><li>Revamped Saluda Pkwy bridge to meet new city grid pattern</li><li>Added entrances to future underground metro in Downtown</li><li>Added several spots of parallel parking spaces along Downtown streets</li><li>Named all current Downtown streets</li><li>Expanded I-67 one thousand blocks in both directions, east and west</li><li>Expanded I-467 further south into the newer south Downtown area</li><li>Added Route 92 and Route 322 in Saluda</li><li>Updated all road signs with new map art highway / route icons</li><li>Added a strip mall at the university entrance</li><li>Updated and moved US Bank Tower in Downtown</li><li>Deepened and revamped Hiwassee River</li><li>Re-added American football stadium from V0.1.0 into Downtown</li><li>Added new city park west of convention centre in Downtown</li><li>Incorporated new sub-district of Downtown, &#x27;Ardna&#x27;</li><li>Changed sidewalk &amp; curb material in Downtown</li><li>Updated map and resource pack to Minecraft version 1.19.1</li><li>Removed one skyscraper</li><li>Shortened I-467 by several hundred blocks in the north (new terminus is at junction with I-67)</li><li>Removed Route 92 suspension bridge in the east</li><li>Removed two parking lots in Downtown (replaced with two new skyscrapers)</li><li>Removed road under former I-467 overpass in Saluda</li></ul><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Planned Features for Future Updates:</span></p><ul><li>Mountains</li><li>Possible new highway (I-340)</li><li>Suburban neighbourhood(s) in Saluda</li><li>Railroad network with large station in Downtown</li><li>Nuclear power plant in East Saluda</li><li>Power Lines</li><li>Low density commerce in East Saluda</li><li>I-467 highway expansion further south</li><li>Jean Karakos International Airport</li><li>More midrise growth along I-467 corridor</li><li>Downtown metro system</li><li>Large park in Ardna district</li><li>City Hall building (will become the future spawnpoint)</li><li>Police / fire stations</li><li>Possible revamped, larger hospital</li></ul><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Frequently Asked Questions:</span></p><p>Q: What is the map&#x27;s version?</p><p>A: 1.20.4</p><p>Q: Where did the name “Bessemer” come from?</p><p>A: It wasn’t named after an existing city, but from the Bessemer steel process, giving a nod towards the city’s main producing product, steel.</p><p>Q: How can I help out?</p><p>A: We’ll let you all know in the comments section about applications when we are ready for it.</p><p>Q: Why do some buildings scattered throughout the map don’t contain interiors?</p><p>A: This is part of an effort to make the city lag less and easier-to-run on low-end devices.</p><p>Q: Is this map roleplay-friendly?</p><p>A: Yes!
